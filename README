This is a basic make file to allow for the easy flashing of AVR Micros from Linux or OSX.

It requires the following:
    avr-gcc
    avr-libc
    avrdude
    make
    
To use:
    Add your user to dialout - `sudo usermod -a -G dialout username` Note: you may need to relog for this to take effect.
    Note: It is best to have a new directory for each project.
    Place this file in the project directory.
    Modify the Makefile to point to the desired directories.
    Make an object direcrory, by default call this obj.
    `make` will compile and link your program and attempt to flash to the avr.
    `make flash` will only attempt to flash.
    `make clean` will remove all object files and the output.hex.

This is currently set for the ATMEGA324A you will need to change both the -mmcu and the -p in avr-gcc and avrdude respectivly.

WARNINGS:

DO NOT DISCONNECT/POWEROFF THE AVR DURING FLASHING, YOU CAN SET A FUSE AND MAKE YOUR LIFE DIFFICULT!
