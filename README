This is a basic make file to allow for the easy flashing of AVR Micros from Linux or OSX.

It requires the following:
    avr-gcc
    avr-libc
    avrdude
    make
    
To use:
    Note: It is best to have a new directory for each project.
    Place this file in the project directory.
    Change the src value to the name of your .c value (With out .c).
    Run make flash this will build and flash the file to the AVR
        If you just want to compile the .c file run make hex (this will make the hex file ready for flashing).
    To clean the directory of unneeded files run make clean.

This is currently set for the ATMEGA324A you will need to change both the -mmcu and the -p in avr-gcc and avrdude respectivly.
